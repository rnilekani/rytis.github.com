Quote from the [TIOBE article](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html):

> Programming language Python has become programming language of 2010. This award is given to the programming language that gained most market share in 2010. Python grew 1.81% since January 2010. This is a bit more than runner up Objective-C (+1.63%). Objective-C was favorite for the title for a long time thanks to the popularity of Apple's iPhone and iPad platforms. However, it lost too much popularity the last couples of months.
>
> Python has become the "de facto" standard in system scripting (being a successor of Perl in this), but it is used for much more different types of application areas nowadays. Python is for instance very popular among web developers, especially in combination with the Django framework. Since Python is easy to learn, more and more universities are using Python to teach programming languages.
